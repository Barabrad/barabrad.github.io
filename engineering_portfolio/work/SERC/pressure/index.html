        <h1>Pressure Measurements</h1>
        <h2>Goal</h2>
        <p>Separate the pressure measurements into their own data stream.</p>
        <h2>Cause</h2>
        <p>The pressure measurements were being mixed in a stream with other data. Because this task was not urgent, it was given to me so I could become familiar with the vehicle's flight software and the ROS2 architecture.</p>
        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>I first cloned the GitHub repository, then began looking into ROS2 and seeing how it was implemented in the flight software. When I saw that the expected output and the code did not match, I started researching the imported libraries. However, I would eventually realize that the repository had not been updated before I cloned it, so the mismatch was cleared up after I saw the updated code.</p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>I was able to separate the pressure data into its own stream. This task was also the first time I was working on files with others on GitHub, so I also learned about the importance of keeping repositories up to date.</p>

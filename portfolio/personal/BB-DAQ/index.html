        <h1>BB-DAQ</h1>
        <h2>Goal</h2>
        <p>Create a workaround for <a href="https://www.parallax.com/package/plx-daq/" target="_blank">PLX-DAQ</a> on Macs, while still maintaining support for Windows.</p>
        <h2>Cause</h2>
        <p>A lab assignment in Spring 2023 required us to write serial data from an Arduino to an Excel spreadsheet using PLX-DAQ. However, PLX-DAQ uses COM ports, which Macs do not have.</p>
        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>Because this project was for an assignment with a close due date, the first iteration was a file that only read and wrote the data without plotting it in live time. Within a week, I added the graphing functionality in preparation for the next assignment with PLX-DAQ. The code remained largely untouched until the following year's students ran an issue due to the different Arduino they were using. After I wrote another file to mitigate that issue for future students, I started to maintain the code as a personal project. Since then, the code has been cleaned up, and more PLX-DAQ functionality has been added.</p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>The code, along with a detailed README file, has been uploaded to a <a href="https://www.github.com/Barabrad/BB-DAQ" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a> for others to use (mainly future students in that class).</p>

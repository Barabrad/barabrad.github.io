        <h1>Flexible Wings</h1>
        <h2>Goal</h2>
        <p>Model a plane with flexible wings.</p>
        <h2>Cause</h2>
        <p>Because wings are not perfectly rigid, simulations with rigid wings are not entirely accurate.</p>
        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>The guidance I was given was to model each wing as a set of rigid beams and torsional springs. Having taken differential equations, my apporach was to start from a simplified 2-beam system and work from there. I first solved each system of ODEs (Ordinary Differential Equations) analytically, then used MATLAB to numerically solve the systems of ODEs when they grew too complex to solve by hand.</p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>By summer's end, I finished the unsimplified 2-beam system. To do so, I had to learn how to use Lagrangian physics (which was suggested by my mentor).</p>

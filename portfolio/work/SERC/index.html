        <h2>SERC Projects</h2>
        <p>The project I worked on at SERC was the Lunar Entry and Approach Platform For Research On Ground (<a href="https://www.isi.edu/centers-serc/research/lunar-lander-prototype/" target="_blank"></a>LEAPFROG</a>). The main subprojects I worked on for LEAPFROG are listed in chronological order, with the oldest at the bottom:</p>

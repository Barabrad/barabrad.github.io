        <h1>Live Telemetry</h1>
        <h2>Goal</h2>
        <p>Find a way to show the lander's telemetry in live time.</p>
        <h2>Cause</h2>
        <p>Previously, we had to type a series of commands to see all of the telemetry data, since each command showed only a small subset of the telemetry.</p>
        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>During an assignment that same semester, I learned about the "gnome-terminal" and "tail" Linux commands, so I realized that I could use them to create another terminal window on the "ground station" laptop that displays live telemetry as it is written to a file. I used a loop with a millisecond timer that appended the current telemetry to the telemetry file every 5 seconds.</p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>The live telemetry code was successfully integrated into the vehicle's flight software, and I added a command in the makefile (on the laptop) that would display the updating window if the user wanted to see the live telemetry. Because the values returned by the telemetry commands lacked context/description, I added that to the telemetry file output.</p>
        <p>This addition would make future sensor testing easier, and would allow the user to verify that the <a href="../recalib/">IMU recalibration</a> had completed, since we no longer need to enter commands to see the telemetry.</p>
